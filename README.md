## Introduction
This project explores **Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning with PyTorch** using transformer-based models.  
The task simulates building a **recommender system for a streaming platform** based on **movie reviews**. Since the dataset of reviews is relatively small, the strategy leverages transfer learning:

1. **Pre-training** on a larger general-domain dataset (e.g., magazine articles or AG News) to capture broad language patterns.  
2. **Fine-tuning** on the smaller IMDB dataset to specialize in sentiment and movie-review-specific nuances.  

This two-step training approach balances **generalization** and **task-specific adaptation**, making it especially effective when data is limited.

## Implementation
1. **Setup & Dependencies**  
   - Installed required libraries (`torch`, `torchtext`, `transformers`, etc.).  
   - Defined helper functions for plotting, saving, and loading models.  

2. **Positional Encodings**  
   - Implemented positional encoding to preserve word order in sequences, which transformers need to differentiate between sentences with the same tokens but different meanings.  

3. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Loaded and preprocessed the **IMDB dataset**.  
   - Created dataset splits (train/test) and built PyTorch DataLoaders for efficient batching.  

4. **Model Training Strategies**  
   - **Training from scratch** on IMDB (to observe overfitting risks with small datasets).  
   - **Full fine-tuning** of a model pretrained on AG News.  
   - **Fine-tuning the final layer only**, keeping earlier layers frozen to reduce compute and overfitting.  
   - **Exercise:** selectively unfreezing specific layers for controlled fine-tuning.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Compared results across different fine-tuning strategies.  
   - Analyzed training/validation loss and accuracy to understand trade-offs.

## Results
- **Training from Scratch**: The model overfit quickly due to the small dataset size.  
- **Full Fine-Tuning**: Provided the best adaptation to the IMDB dataset but required more compute and posed some overfitting risk.  
- **Final Layer Fine-Tuning**: Efficient, less prone to overfitting, but with slightly reduced accuracy compared to full fine-tuning.  
- **Layer-Unfreezing Strategy**: Balanced efficiency and accuracy by adapting deeper model layers only where necessary.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning with PyTorch. By pretraining on a large general-domain dataset and fine-tuning on a smaller domain-specific dataset, the model achieves strong performance without requiring massive amounts of labeled data.

**Key takeaways**:

- Pretraining captures general language structure.

- Fine-tuning adapts the model to the target task.

- Strategies such as final-layer fine-tuning and partial layer unfreezing balance accuracy, efficiency, and overfitting risks.

This methodology is widely applicable to real-world NLP tasks where labeled data is limited but pretrained models are available.
