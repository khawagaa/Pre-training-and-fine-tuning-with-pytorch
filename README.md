Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to pretrain and fine-tune transformer-based neural networks in PyTorch.
The lab focuses on building a recommender system for a streaming service using movie reviews as the target dataset, while leveraging transfer learning from a larger dataset of magazine articles.

📌 Overview

Fine-tuning a pretrained model can be approached in different ways:

Training only on the small movie review dataset

✅ Tailored to the dataset

⚠️ Risk of overfitting due to limited data

Pretraining on a general large dataset, then fine-tuning all parameters

✅ Improves accuracy on the target task

⚠️ Computationally expensive and may still overfit

Fine-tuning only the final layer

✅ Efficient and reduces overfitting

⚠️ Limited adaptation to domain-specific patterns

This notebook walks through all these strategies step by step.

🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

Define and pretrain a transformer-based neural network using PyTorch

Fully fine-tune the pretrained model for a different classification task

Compare results by fine-tuning only the last layer of the pretrained model

Experiment with unfreezing specific layers for controlled fine-tuning
