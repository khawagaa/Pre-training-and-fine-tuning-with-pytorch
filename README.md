# Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to **pretrain and fine-tune transformer-based neural networks in PyTorch**.

The lab focuses on building a recommender system for a streaming service using **movie reviews** as the target dataset, while leveraging **transfer learning** from a larger dataset of magazine articles.

## üìå Overview

Fine-tuning a pretrained model can be approached in different ways:

- **Training only on the small movie review dataset**
    - ‚úÖ Tailored to the dataset
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of overfitting due to limited data

- **Pretraining on a general large dataset, then fine-tuning all parameters**
    - ‚úÖ Improves accuracy on the target task
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Computationally expensive and may still overfit

- **Fine-tuning only the final layer**
    - ‚úÖ Efficient and reduces overfitting
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited adaptation to domain-specific patterns

This notebook walks through all these strategies step by step.

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Define and pretrain a transformer-based neural network using **PyTorch**.
- Fully fine-tune the pretrained model for a **different classification task**.
- Compare results by fine-tuning only the **last layer** of the pretrained model.
- Experiment with **unfreezing specific layers** for controlled fine-tuning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1) Install required libraries

Run these commands in your terminal or inside a notebook cell (prepend `!` in notebooks if desired):

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install matplotlib seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
2) Import required libraries
Import libraries at the top of the notebook before running code cells. Example:

python
Copy code
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
3) Helper functions
The notebook includes helper functions for tokenization, dataset preparation, and training loops. Follow the notebook cells to see how they are defined and used.

üöÄ Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/khawagaa/Pre-training-and-fine-tuning-with-pytorch.git
cd Pre-training-and-fine-tuning-with-pytorch
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open Lab_Pre_training_and_Fine_Tuning_with_PyTorch.ipynb and follow the steps in order.


üìä Datasets
IMDB Dataset: Movie reviews for fine-tuning.

AG News Dataset: Large text dataset for pretraining.

Both datasets are automatically downloaded via PyTorch's torchtext or other dataset utilities used in the notebook.
